<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target+"_blank" title="source_wikipedia">
JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a <strong>high-level, dynamic, weakly typed,
  prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language</strong>.
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
  of World Wide Web content production.
  It is used to make webpages <u>interactive and provide online programs,
  including video games.</u> The majority of websites employ it,
  and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins
  by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.
  Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation
  of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification,
  with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines
  supporting additional features beyond ECMA. </p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">As a multi-paradigm language,
  JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
  (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
  It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions,
  and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include
  any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,
  relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
